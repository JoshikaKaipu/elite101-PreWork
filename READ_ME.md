The file, chatbot.py, takes user input to run certain functions.
The file cb.functions.py has multiple functions in it that each correspond to a specific task. Most of these functions are called in the chatbot.py file but a few are called
within other functions. Some functions, depending on the user input, may allow the user to do another task within that one call.
